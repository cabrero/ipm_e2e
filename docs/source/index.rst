This library helps in writting of automated *end to end* tests when a
graphical user interface is involved.

To achive its goal, it offers a functional api that performs
programmatically the usual interactions with the graphical interface,
on behalf of a human user.

Right now it only works with applications that implement the AT-SPI.

Maybe you'd like to think about this library as a higher level
abstraction of the AT-SPI api.
